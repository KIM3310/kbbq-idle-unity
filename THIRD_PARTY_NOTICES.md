# Third-Party Notices

This repository is intended to be a lightweight portfolio snapshot containing mostly original code and Unity YAML assets (scene/prefabs/ScriptableObjects).

## Unity
- Built with Unity Editor `2022.3.x` LTS (Unity is not distributed with this repository).
- The project may reference Unity-provided packages via `Packages/manifest.json` that are resolved by Unity.

## Asset Store / External Media
At the time of publishing, this repository does **not** include third-party redistributable media assets such as:
- textures/images (`.png`, `.jpg`, ...),
- audio (`.wav`, `.mp3`, ...),
- fonts (`.ttf`, `.otf`, ...),
- 3D models (`.fbx`, `.obj`, ...),
- proprietary plugins/binaries (`.dll`, `.so`, ...).

If you add such assets later, ensure the licenses permit redistribution and update this file accordingly.
